# 2048 Game

This is a simple implementation of the popular game 2048 using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
2. Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to move the tiles on the board.
3. Tiles with the same number will merge when they collide.
4. The goal is to reach the 2048 tile by merging tiles and scoring high!
